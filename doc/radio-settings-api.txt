Radio settings hierarchy
========================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.RadioSettings
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all radio access properties. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as read-write are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.DoesNotExist
					 [service].Error.InProgress

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string TechnologyPreference [read-write]

			The current radio access selection mode, also known
			as network preference.

			The possible values are:
				"any"	Radio access technology
					selection is done automatically,
					based on reception and
					availability.
				"gsm"	Only GSM used for radio access.
				"umts"	Only UMTS used for radio access.
				"lte"	Only LTE used for radio acccess.

		boolean	FastDormancy [read-write, optional]

			This property will enable or disable fast
			dormancy. Fast dormancy refers to UE initiated
			release of radio resources quickly after a
			burst of data transfer has ended. Normally,
			radio resources are released by the network
			after a timeout configured by the network
			operator. Fast dormancy allows the modem to
			release radio resources more quickly.
			Typically, fast dormancy would be enabled if
			no data transfer is predicted to occur in the
			near future, for instance, when the end user
			is not actively using the device. This is a
			major power-saving feature for mobile devices,
			but can be ignored for USB sticks or PCI
			devices.

			If the modem does not support such a feature
			the property should never be exposed to the
			user.

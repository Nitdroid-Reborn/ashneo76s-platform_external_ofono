CDMA VoiceCallManager hierarchy [experimental]
===============================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.cdma.VoiceCallManager
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		void Dial(string number)

			Initiates a new outgoing call.  This is usually
			implemented using the ATD AT command.

		void Hangup()

			Hangup all active calls.

		void Answer()

			Answer the incoming call.  This only affects the
			incoming call.

		void SendFlash(string flash_string)

			Sends the flash string to the network.

		void SendTones(string tones)

			Sends the DTMF tones to the network.  The tones have
			a fixed duration.  Tones can be one of: '0' - '9',
			'*', '#', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'.  The last four are
			typically not used in normal circumstances.

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			Signal is emitted whenever a property has changed.
			The new value is passed as the signal argument.

Properties	string State [readonly]

			Contains the state of the current call.  The state
			can be one of:
				- "active" - The call is active
				- "dialing" - The call is being dialed
				- "alerting" - The remote party is being alerted
				- "incoming" - Incoming call in progress
				- "disconnected" - No call is connected

		boolean CallWaiting [readonly]

			Contains whether a call is waiting.

		string CallWaitingNumber [readonly, optional]

			Contains the call waiting number.

		DisconnectReason(string reason)

			This signal is emitted when the modem manager can
			provide extra information about why the call was
			released. The possible reason values are:
				"local" - The call was release due to local
						user action
				"remote" - Remote party released the call
				"network" - Network released the call, most
						likely due to low signal or
						other network failure

			Not all implementations are able to provide this
			information, so applications should treat the emission
			of this signal as optional. This signal will be
			emitted before the PropertyChanged signal.

		string ToneDuration [readwrite]

			Contains the length of the DTMF tone duration.  The
			currently supported values are:
				"short",
				"long"

Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with oFono codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


SMS
===

- Add support for Enhanced SMS (EMS) from 3GPP 23.040.  These SMS messages
  support a richer set of formatting elements, including bold/italic and
  font size selection.  Embedding images and sounds into the SMS is also
  supported.  This task should add support for receiving such SMS messages.

  Proposed solution is to convert such messages to HTML and embed image /
  sound data as embedded MIME in the generated HTML stream.  The EMS messages
  will have to be detected (by the presence of particular tags in the SMS)
  and signaled separately from simple SMS messages.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- Source / Destination port addressing scheme from 3GPP 23.040.  A special
  header is used to indicate the source / destination port of the application
  this SMS message belongs to.  Such messages which are encoded in 8-bit should
  be decoded by oFono automatically.  The handler associated with this source /
  destination port is called with the decoded stream.

  Proposed solution involves a registration / callback framework in the SMS
  atom for plugins to register handlers.  Default (wildcard) handler is also
  desired.

- Smart Messaging Service.  This is a separate standard from Nokia and uses
  the 3GPP 23.040 source / destination addressing scheme.  The main aim of
  this task is to support vCards and vCalendar objects over SMS.

  Proposed solution is to add a plugin with an extension API to send / receive
  such messages.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Depends: Source / Destination port scheme

- WAP PUSH notification support for MMS.  oFono should be able to receive
  WAP PUSH messages over SMS, parse them and report them to the upper level
  MMS stack.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- See / Cancel pending SMS messages over DBus.  When oFono sends SMS messages
  the method call is only returned when the message has been submitted to the
  network.  Instead we should return an object path and allow cancellation of
  pending messages.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Persist outgoing SMS messages.  Currently oFono persists incoming messages
  that are fragmented.  However oFono does not persist queued outgoing
  messages.  oFono should persist such messages and restore / requeue them
  on the next oFono startup.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1
  Owner: Kristen Carlson Accardi <kristen@linux.intel.com>

- Add CDMA support to the SMS stack. The idea is to support only the PDU
  mode. To start with only Submit and Deliver message handling for WMT
  teleservice will be added to bring the basic CDMA SMS send and receive
  functionality.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8
  Owner: Rajesh Kadhiravan Nagaiah <Rajesh.Nagaiah@elektrobit.com>

- Add CDMA Delivery(Status) Report handling to the SMS stack.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4
  Owner: Rajesh Kadhiravan Nagaiah <Rajesh.Nagaiah@elektrobit.com>

- Add CDMA Voice Mail Notification handling to the SMS stack. In CDMA the
  Message Waiting indication is notified through a specific teleservice ID
  VMN. No update to corresponding elementary files required since they are
  not present in the R-UIM. This will result in the message waiting
  indication being initially processed within the SMS atom and then being
  passed for delivery to the message waiting atom. Furthemore note that in
  CDMA only voice mail type is supported.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4
  Owner: Rajesh Kadhiravan Nagaiah <Rajesh.Nagaiah@elektrobit.com>

SIM / SIM File system
=====================

- Barred Dialing numbers support.  BDN will not be supported by oFono.
  If BDN service enabled SIM is used, oFono will go into emergency mode.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Jeevaka Badrappan <jeevaka.badrappan@elektrobit.com>

- Read / Write EFcfis.  Call forwarding settings can be bootstrapped on the
  SIM for faster notification of the user that call forwarding is active.
  These settings are stored in EFcfis.  oFono should read these settings and
  update the call history atom appropriately.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- SIM Call History plugin.  New UICCs support four new SIM elementary files
  for storing call history information on the SIM: EFici, EFict, EFoci, EFoct.
  A plugin should be developed for oFono that will write to these files.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Support proprietary extensions for SIM PIN retry counter.  Most vendors
  provide an extension commands to obtain such a retry counter for PINs and
  PUKs.  Need to enable this as a property in oFono.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for SIM 'ready' notifications from the driver to the core.  Most
  modem manufacturers initialize the SIM (e.g. cache SIM file system, STK
  initialization, etc) internally before allowing the telephony stack to
  access these portions.  When the PIN is locked, this can lead to oFono being
  too fast for the modem and asking it for things before the firmware is ready.

  The proposal is to introduce a new sim function:
    void ofono_sim_ready_notify(struct ofono_sim *sim);

  When oFono determines the SIM PIN is READY, it checks whether
  ofono_sim_ready_notify has been called.  If it hasn't, then it stalls the
  initialization procedure (and calling post_sim) until
  ofono_sim_ready_notify is called.

Modem Emulator
==============

- Support HFP AG emulator.  We should provide a new HFP_AG_EMULATOR atom type
  that will implement the Bluetooth HFP AG profile.  Voicecall atom, netreg
  atoms can register command handlers for this atom appropriately.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium

- Support extensions to HFP AG emulator.  Some carkits support additional
  AT command extensions to the Bluetooth HFP AG standard.  Refer to CE4A
  white paper: "AT-commands for Automotive Premium Phone Integration".
  Plugins can register additional command handlers appropriately to handle
  such commands.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium
  Depends: HFP AG emulator

- Support HSP AG.  Similar to HFP AG emulator but implements the much reduced
  Bluetooth HSP AG profile.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C1

- Support DUN emulator. Implement the Bluetooth DUN profile with only mandatory
  AT command support.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium

  Depends: PPP Server mode

- Support Bluetooth SPP profile.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium


Flight Mode
===========

- Flight Mode support.  Add an 'Online' property to the Modem interface that
  will control the online state of the modem.  When Online state is True all
  atoms are available.  When Online state is False, all network related items
  are removed (e.g. CallSettings) or enter into reduced functionality set
  where only the SIM is available (e.g. DataConnectionManager, SimManager, etc)

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: High
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>


GPRS
====

- PPP Server support.  Extend GAtPPP to support PPP Server role, similarly to
  how existing GSM modems support PPP GPRS contexts.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- IPv6 CP support.  To support IPv6 based GPRS contexts via PPP, GAtPPP
  needs to be updated to support IPv6CP from RFC 2472.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4

- On-demand SOCKS5 proxy support for MMS contexts.  When an MMS context type
  is created, oFono should create a SOCKS5 proxy.  When a client connects to
  the proxy, oFono can activate the GPRS context on-demand.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for IPv6 GPRS contexts.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1


Location Services
=================

- Neighbor Cell Info.  Add dedicated atom, D-Bus API and atom driver(s) for
  Neighbor Cell information.

  This feature is not discussed in 27.007, thus manufacturer specific commands
  are required.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium


Supplementary Services
======================

- Closed User Group (CUG) support.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- Call Completion to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) support

  This feature is not discussed in 27.007, thus manufacturer specific commands
  are required.

  atoms.  3GPP service is accessed by the +CDIP command.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4

- CPHS Support.  This includes ALS and CPHS specific elementary files.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8


Voicecall
=========

- Supplementary service notifications on remote party actions:
  - call has been put on hold (+CSSU: 2)
  - call has been retrieved (+CSSU: 3), and
  - joining call to a multiparty conference (+CSSU: 4)

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>

- Long phone numbers. According to 3GPP TS 24.008, the callee address
  can be up to 80 digits long.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- Dial strings. Include CLIR prefixes and 2nd stage dial strings in the
  DialString call property. Add dialstring accessor method to C API.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C4

- Provide feedback of sent DTMF tones. Emit SendingTones signal if modem can
  provide approximate starting and stopping times for DTMF tones. Signal
  argument contains a string of DTMF tones to be sent, or empty string when
  all tones has been sent.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>


Sim Toolkit
===========

- Support the Play Tone proactive command.  This should be implemented
  by making the appropriate call into the SimToolkitAgent.  The sound
  that will be played will be determined by the agent based on the sound
  type.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Support Refresh proactive command.  The specification defines 7 types
  of Refresh types:
	- NAA Initialization
	- NAA File Change Notification
	- NAA Initialization and File Change Notification
	- NAA Initialization and Full File Change Notification
	- UICC Reset
	- NAA Application Reset (2G only)
	- NAA Session Reset (3G only)

  The 'NAA Initialization' type will be ignored by oFono, it is assumed
  this is handled by the modem.

  For 'UICC Reset', 'NAA Application Reset' and 'NAA Session Reset' oFono
  will first check whether there are any calls or ussd operations active.
  If there are, the appropriate response will be sent (e.g. busy on call
  or screen busy terminal response.)  Otherwise a positive response will be
  sent to the driver.  In the case of a 'UICC Reset' the driver / modem
  can interpret this that it is safe to reset the UICC.

  Alternatively, the driver / modem can notify the core of the SIM removal
  / SIM insertion events without using the Refresh proactive command.  It
  is up to the driver / modem to perform a warm reset.  In particular, 3GPP
  31.111 mandates that any change to EFimsi is done by using 'UICC Reset',
  'NAA Application Reset' or 'NAA Session Reset'.  Please see 3GPP 31.111
  Section 6.4.7.1.

  Other types will be handled by oFono flushing the EF cache of the files
  affected (or the entire SIM cache in case of Full File Change Notifications)
  and re-reading the affected files.  Any properties derived from these
  Elementary Files will be updated and signaled using PropertyChanged.

- Support Set Up Call proactive command.  If the UICC has indicated that
  the user should be informed, then the SimToolkitAgent will be called
  in order to request user's confirmation of the call setup.  If the user
  has confirmed, or if user's confirmation was not requested, oFono will
  setup the call and optionally inform the user.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C8

- Support 'SMS-PP' Download Envelope.  Whenever a special type of SMS is
  received indicating that this is an SMS-PP Download message, this message
  will be sent to the SIM via an SMS-PP Download Envelope.  No user interaction
  will be required.  If the modem hardware supports this transparently, then
  no indication to oFono will be necessary.

  Priority: High

Emergency Calls
===============

- Modem Emergency mode.  Support network registration and online/offline
  mode during the emergency calls and related network activity (e.g.,
  network-initiated location request via supplementary service channel).

  Proposed solution is to introduce a new Emergency boolean property to the
  Modem D-Bus interface and new functions to modem interface:

  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_inc()
  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_dec()
  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_get()
  - ofono_modem_add_emergency_mode_watch()
  - ofono_modem_remove_emergency_mode_watch()

  When emergency mode is requested, modem is set to online (if needed) and
  the watchers are notified. There can be multiple parties requesting
  emergency mode.  When all of them have completed the emergency-related
  operation and called ofono_modem_emergency_mode_dec(), modem is set to
  offline (if needed) and the watchers are again notified.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Country / Operator specific emergency numbers.  Figure out how to support
  countries / operators with specific mandated emergency numbers which are
  not part of the standard emergency number list. This needs to be queried
  by the voicecall atom every time a new SIM is inserted.  The list is
  assumed to be managed by the modem.  If no such functionality is available,
  then the 3GPP mandated behavior is used.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Network updating the emergency number list. Support the list of emergency
  numbers dynamically updated by the network.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Extend the voicecall interface with a property indicating whether this call
  is an emergency call (essentially the CLI matches one of the numbers on the
  emergency calling codes list.)

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1


Miscellaneous
=============

- Bluetooth SAP Client support.  The Telit UC864-G devices support Bluetooth
  SAP client mode.  This requires the use of a modem side-channel to read the
  APDU & CPDU data and send it to the remote phone device over Bluetooth RFCOMM
  channel.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Low

- Frequency Band Selection.  Add frequency band selection capability to the
  RadioSettings atom.

  This feature is not discussed in 27.007, thus manufacturer specific commands
  are required.

  Complexity: C2

- PolicyKit support.  Add support for PolicyKit checking of all oFono D-Bus
  interfaces.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Low

- Internet Access Provider database.  Have oFono automatically configure
  GPRS contexts based on an internal database.  Database format to be decided.
  If there are multiple matches in the database, then some user intervention
  might be required.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C8

- Support for modem 'silent' reset notifications.  oFono will remove all atoms
  and re-initialize.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for Modem 'power down & lock' and 'unlock & power up'.  When the
  'power down & lock' is given, the calling application is noted and all
  other applications are blocked from powering up the modem.  Only the calling
  application can lift the lock.  Alternatively, if the calling application
  exits prematurely the lock is lifted as well.

  The proposed property name is "Lockdown" as part of the Modem interface.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- Add a property for Fast Dormancy in the RadioSettings atom. This property
  will enable or disable Fast Dormancy. Fast Dormancy refers to UE initiated
  release of radio resources quickly after a burst of data transfer has ended.
  Normally, radio resources are released by the network after a timeout
  configured by the network operator. Fast Dormancy allows the modem to release
  radio resources more quickly. Typically, fast dormancy would be enabled
  if no data transfer is predicted to occur in the near future (e.g. end user
  is not actively using the device). This is a major power-saving feature for
  mobile devices, but can be ignored for USB sticks or PCI devices.

  If the modem does not support such a feature the property should never be
  exposed to the user.

  This feature is not discussed in 27.007, thus manufacturer specific commands
  are required.

- TTY (hearing impaired) support.  Add a new oFono atom type that will enable
  the user to enable or disable the TTY support on the modem.  Support for
  automatic detection of TTY (signaled by the driver) is also desired.

  This feature is not discussed in 27.007, thus manufacturer specific commands
  are required.

  Priority: High

- Add support for GPS power control atom.  Many modem manufacturers provide
  a GPS unit with their modem hardware.  This unit can be turned on or off
  and frequently takes over one of the tty ports that the modem provides.
